# Competitive Programming Practice

This repository is used for me to practice some algorithm and data structure problems on Kattis. Currently, I am following the problem lists for [NUS CS3233 Competitive Programming AY2020-2021 Semester 2](https://nus.kattis.com/courses/CS3233/CS3233_S2_AY2021). I am most proficient in coding with `Java`, but I'm also practising to code with `C++`. Therefore, multiple versions of the same solution coded in different programming language may be provided in this repository. I believe that appropriate comments along the code are sufficient to aid readers to understand the logic, so only the code and relevant testing files will be contained, instead of seperate files explaining my solutions.

## Problem list

Newly-solved problems are listed on the top of the table.
