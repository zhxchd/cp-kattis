# Competitive Programming Practice

This repository is used for me to practice some algorithm and data structure problems on Kattis. Currently, I am following the problem lists for [NUS CS3233 Competitive Programming AY2020-2021 Semester 2](https://nus.kattis.com/courses/CS3233/CS3233_S2_AY2021). I am most proficient in coding with `Java`, but I'm also practising to code with `C++`. Therefore, multiple versions of the same solution coded in different programming language may be provided in this repository. I believe that appropriate comments along the code are sufficient to aid readers to understand the logic, so only
